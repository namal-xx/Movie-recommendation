### ðŸ“ŒWhat I did:

* **Data preprocessing:** Cleaned and handled missing values, applies `ast.literal_eval()` and `Vectorization` on text and performed `NLP` techniques to get results.
* **Text Vectorization & Similarity:** Used vectorization and applied techniques like `cosine_similarity` to find similarity between movies.
* **Recommendation Function** Created a function for recommendation that returns 5 movies based on the selective movie.
* **Streamlit Interface:** Created a `Streamlit` interface that instantly recommends 5 movies based on the user-selective movie.
