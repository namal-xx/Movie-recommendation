### ðŸ“ŒWhat I did:

* **Data preprocessing** (cleaned and handled missing values, applies `ast` and `Vectorization` on text and performed `NLP` techniques to get results.)
* **Text Vectorization** and applied techniques like `cosine` to find similarity between movies.
* Created a function for recommendation.
* Created a `Streamlit` interface that instantly recommends 5 movies based on the user-selective movie.

* `Python` - `Pandas` - `NumPy` - `Scikit-learn` - `Streamlit`
